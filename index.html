          is a two player abstract strategy game with thirty-six
          unique hexagonal tiles. They are named things like Tower,
          Day, Night, Sword&mdash;each has a black side and white side
          that are otherwise identical.</p>

        <p>One player will play as black and the other as white. They
          take turns playing tiles from a common pool until all have
          been played. Each tile has a unique action that affects the
          tiles around it, the score, or some other gameplay
          element. At the end of the game, each player will score
          points for the tiles showing their side plus any bonus point
          tokens they have earned. Win by having the highest
          score!</p>
